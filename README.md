# Introduction to LangChain Chains

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using LangChain chains. The notebook demonstrates how to implement and utilize various types of chains in LangChain, including LLMChain, Sequential Chains, SimpleSequentialChain, SequentialChain, and Router Chain.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction-to-LangChain-Chains.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of LangChain chains, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to understand and use:

- LLMChain
- Sequential Chains
  - SimpleSequentialChain
  - SequentialChain
- Router Chain

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-LangChain-Chains.git
    cd Introduction-to-LangChain-Chains
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
